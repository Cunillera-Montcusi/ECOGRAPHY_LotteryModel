Disturbances, such as wildfires, are one of the main drivers of biodiversity dynamics and their frequency and intensity are expected to increase due to global change. Such disturbances generate a mosaic of affected and unaffected patches that change the landscape structure and, consequently, the metacommunity network. Therefore, to fully understand the consequences of such disturbances, a landscape perspective is required. In 2012, a wildfire burned 13,000 hectares in the NE Iberian Peninsula affecting a pond macroinvertebrate metacommunity. Communities were strongly resilient to this disturbance, recovering after one hydroperiod. Their resilience was related to dispersal and was lower in species with small dispersal ability. This suggested that metacommunity network was playing a major role in defining system resilience. In this context, we introduce a theoretical analysis based on this network in which we evaluate metacommunity resilience across several gradients of disturbance size and intensity incorporating species dispersal ability. Our study supports the empirical observation of a highly resilient metacommunity but also reveals that increased disturbance regimes might lead to a collapse of this resilience. Disturbance size and intensity interacted determining community recovery rate which had high values when both were low. Nevertheless, the transition from high to low resilience was sharp and depending on species dispersal. Diversity recovery was mostly driven by disturbance intensity, abruptly collapsing with its rise. This response highlighted the qualitative difference in the effect of size and intensity. These results not only illustrate the mechanisms shaping the studied metacommunity but more generally, they stress the strong role of metacommunity mechanisms and landscape structure on biodiversity resilience. Finally, this study highlights the importance of using theoretical approaches rooted in empirical data to comprehend metacommunity dynamics and the need to preserve and build connected and heterogenous landscapes to face future disturbance scenarios.
